# Deno Fresh Starter

This is an opinionated starter project for Deno Fresh with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to set the groundwork for developing fullstack apps using Cursor/Tailwind IDEs relying heavily on AI code generation. AI works best when given examples, so this is what the project is providing.

Once you get ready to release your first version, ask AI to remove or disable the example code.
